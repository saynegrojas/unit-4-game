# unit-4-game
crystal collector

Here's how the app works:

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, a random number will be added to the player's total score.

The player wins if the total score matches the random number displayed from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. And the user's score will reset to zero.

There's a tracker of the number of games the player wins and loses.
